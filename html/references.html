                <p>In the popular TV series, The Office, Dwight Schrute portrayed Belsnickel at an office
                    Christmas party. He spent most of his night determining if his coworkers were "impish or
                    admirable," a knockoff of "naughty or nice." He gives out German food, treats, and gifts
                    to his admirable coworkers, and coal to his impish coworkers. Dwight even hits Jim repeatedly
                    with his switch when Jim announces he is taking a new job in Philadelphia. </p>

                            <p>An edgy portrayal of Belsnickel in The Christmas Chronicles 2. He is not
                                an evil character canonically, but in this movie his goal is to destroy
                                Christmas and kill Santa. You can see a classic drawing of Belsnickel in
                                the image as well, as he prepares to use his switch on a screaming child in front of his family.
                                Merry Christmas.</p>

                            <p>This is probably the coolest Santa I've ever seen. It makes sense
                                that this Santa was able to defeat that angsty, teen version of Belsnickel.
                                Belsnickel is only the 5th most popular gift-bringer in German folklore after all,
                                but Santa is the undeniable best gift-bringer in the US.
                            </p>
                            <p>Apparently Santa wins the fight against Belsnickel by having his 
                                elves start a snowball fight, which gives Santa the opening to rescue an
                                imprisoned Jack Frost. Santa and Jack take down Belsnickel.
