            <h2>About Belsnickel</h2>
            <p>
                One of the strangest encounters I've ever had was with a family in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. We were trying to purchase a Boston
                Terrier puppy from them. They said they put the puppy up for adoption because it was a Christmas gift for their kids, but they
                misbehaved so badly that Belsnickel took the puppy away. Allow me to introduce you to one of the most random legends of the
                northeastern United States: 
            </p>
            <p>
                Belsnickel is a crotchety, fur-clad Christmas gift-bringer in the folklore of southwestern Germany, 
                Pennsylvania Dutch communities, and even some areas of Brazil. 
                He's basically a slightly sinister and really ugly helper to Saint Nicholas.
                He is apparently the 5th most popular gift-bringing figure in German folklore, right behind Saint Nicholas, 
                Christkindl, Der Weihnachtsmann, and Knecht Ruprecht (yes, he's quite a big deal).

                <li>Belsnickel is a man wearing furs and sometimes a mask with a long tongue.</li>
                <li>Belsnickel is very ragged and disheveled, wearing torn and dirty clothes.</li>
                <li>Belsnickel carries a switch in his hand to terrorize and scare naughty children.</li>
                <li>Belsnickel also carries pockets full of cakes, candies, and nuts for good children
                    (In case getting hit by a ragged old man with a branch was not enough incentive to be good).
