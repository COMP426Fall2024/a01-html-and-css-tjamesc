                <p>Belsnickel is one of many companions of Saint Nicholas in German folklore. While it's unsure when the myth started, 
                    he may have been based on an older German myth, Knecht Ruprecht (see picture above), a servant of Saint Nicholas 
                    and a character from northern Germany. Strangely, Belsnickel does not accompany Saint Nicholas 
                    but instead visits homes and children alone and also combines traditional gift-bringing stories with
                    threats, malice, and fear.</p>

                <h2>Alleghenies</h2>
                <p>In an account from Maryland in the 1830s, misbehaved children saw a mysterious person (Belsnickel) 
                    in the shadows and hiding behind trees. Belsnickel always appeared at night, thoroughly disguised.
                    He wore a female garb to hide his intense strength and appear friendly to others.
                    He would wander with sack on his shoulder filled with cakes, nuts, and fruits for deserving children.
                    He also had a wooden branch which was used to strike bad children--it had a charm inside to make
                    the children more generous and respectful.</p>
